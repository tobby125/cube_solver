Libraries installed: tkinter, time
Files in directory: solver_2x2.py, solver_3x3.py, color_input.py, visual_cube.py, solver.py
Main program: cube_solver>solver.py
2x2 solver(optimal) and 3x3 solver(suboptimal, maximum move count: 24)

Additional files: scrambles.txt, run_time.txt
Paste scrambles in scrambles.txt, each move separated by spaces
Writes solution to each scramble and run time in run_time.txt

Each move for 2x2 solver must be in (U, U', U2, R, R', R2, F, F', F2)
cube_solver>solver_2x2.py
(suboptimal 2x2 solve to enhance speed, maximum move count: 11)

Each move for 3x3 solver must be in (U, U', U2, D, D', D2, R', R', R2, L, L', L2, F, F', F2, B, B', B2)
